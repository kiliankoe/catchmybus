{"name":"catchmybus","tagline":"DVB info in the OS X menubar","body":"#catchmybus\r\n\r\nA simple little app that lives in the Mac's menubar and displays when the next bus or tram leaves the stop you specify (in Dresden, Germany).\r\nYou can also choose a specific bus or tram to be notified about when it's getting close.\r\n\r\nThe selection of custom stops is unfortunately not possible quite yet. It's coming :blush:\r\n\r\nRuns on OS X 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite.\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nClick [here](https://github.com/kiliankoe/catchmybus/releases/latest) for the latest release.\r\n\r\n## Screenshot\r\n\r\n![screenshot](./screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n## Compiling\r\n\r\nYou'll need a Mac running OS X 10.10 Yosemite as it's unfortunately not possible to build Swift apps on anything below. You'll still be able to run the app on Mavericks though. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kiliankoe/catchmybus/releases/latest) if you want to run it on 10.9 Mavericks.\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nName and idea shamelessly stolen from [hoodie/catch-my-bus](https://github.com/hoodie/catch-my-bus).\r\n\r\nThere's a very similar version to catchmybus built with Python and GTK if you're looking for something that will run on other systems. Check that out here: [devmeepo/catch-my-bus-python](https://github.com/devmeepo/catch-my-bus-python).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
