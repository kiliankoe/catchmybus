#catchmybus

A simple little app that lives in the Mac's menubar and displays when the next bus or tram leaves the stop you specify (in Dresden, Germany).
You can also choose a specific bus or tram to be notified about when it's getting close.

The selection of custom stops is unfortunately not possible quite yet. It's coming :blush:

Runs on OS X 10.9 Mavericks and 10.10 Yosemite.

## Compiling

You'll need a Mac running OS X 10.10 Yosemite as it's unfortunately not possible to build Swift apps on anything below. You'll still be able to run the app on Mavericks though. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/kiliankoe/catchmybus/releases/latest) if you want to run it on 10.9 Mavericks.

Name and idea shamelessly stolen from [hoodie/catch-my-bus](https://github.com/hoodie/catch-my-bus).

There's a very similar version to catchmybus built with Python and GTK if you're looking for something that will run on other systems. Check that out here: [devmeepo/catch-my-bus-python](https://github.com/devmeepo/catch-my-bus-python).
